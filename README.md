# Uderstanding User Experience Using Dental Reviews

- The overarching goal of this Project is to understand what dental reviews tell us about user experience.
- The project has two objectives:
  1. Using Python and BeautifulSoup to scrap unstructured data (dentist practicing in New York) from Yelp.
  2. Using Natural Language Processing for sentimental analysis of the dentist review.
